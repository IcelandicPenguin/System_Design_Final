# System_Design_Final
 This is the repositroy containing my project for system design and analysis

Features of the project: 
Mutiple paths to take you to and from pages using the buttons in the banner at the top of the website
A managment name entry in order to enter the management tab
Various design implementation to make it feel like a real website

Note: I did have an issue getting images to load and attempted to remedy this through various mean. I am unsure if it is something on my end.
